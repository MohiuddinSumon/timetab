    <h1>TimeTab Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 10/20/2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to TimeTab ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our TimeTab application.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Calendar data: We access your Google Calendar events to display them in the application.</li>
        <li>Google user profile information: We collect your name and profile picture to personalize your experience.</li>
        <li>Usage data: We may collect information on how you use the application to improve our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain our service</li>
        <li>Personalize your experience</li>
        <li>Improve our application</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about our service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We use encryption to protect your Google OAuth tokens and store them locally on your device. We do not store your calendar data or personal information on our servers.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use Google Calendar API to access your calendar data. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for more information on how they handle your data.</p>

    <h2>6. Google API Scopes</h2>
    <p>TimeTab uses the following Google API scopes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly</strong>: This scope allows TimeTab to view your Google Calendar events.</li>
        <li><strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile</strong>: This scope allows TimeTab to access your basic profile information, such as your name and profile picture.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use these scopes for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The calendar.events.readonly scope is necessary to fetch and display your upcoming events in the TimeTab interface. We use this to show you your current and upcoming events, helping you manage your time effectively.</li>
        <li>The userinfo.profile scope is used to personalize your experience by displaying your name and profile picture in the application.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have chosen these specific scopes to balance functionality with privacy. A lesser scope would not provide sufficient access to deliver the core features of TimeTab:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Without calendar.events.readonly, we would not be able to display your calendar events, which is a core feature of TimeTab.</li>
        <li>Without userinfo.profile, we would not be able to personalize your experience with your name and profile picture.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's important to note that TimeTab does not modify your calendar data in any way. We only read the data to display it in our application.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access the personal information we hold about you</li>
        <li>Request that we correct any personal information we hold about you</li>
        <li>Request that we delete any information we hold about you</li>
        <li>Opt out of any marketing communications we may send you</li>
        <li>Revoke TimeTab's access to your Google Calendar and profile information at any time through your Google Account settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
